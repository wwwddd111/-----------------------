# Approved implementation baseline (DEMO)

## Source reference observations

- Video length ~14.56 seconds, vertical 576×1248 recording.
- ~0–10 seconds: a purple native Telegram gift card from user Franklin, artwork for `Input Key #25057`, line «предлагает Вам 1 000 Stars», active countdown, buttons «Отклонить» / «Принять».
- ~11–13 seconds: a follow-up state «Подарок успешно продан», with «Передать» / «Как передать?» buttons.
- Attached screenshot: Telegram modal with numbered instructions.
- Native UI and its payment claims are **not** reproduced as a Telegram system operation; the project uses honest demo captions and regular Telegram buttons.

## Stack decision

| Component | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Python 3.12 | Mature deployment/runtime |
| HTTP + Telegram Bot API | aiohttp + direct official HTTPS requests | No non-official MTProto methods; full control of new Business Bot API fields |
| Webhook | aiohttp web.Application | Public HTTPS webhook served by Railway domain; optional secret header |
| DB | Railway PostgreSQL | Persistent, transactional; row locks and SKIP LOCKED |
| Database mapper | SQLAlchemy 2 | Clear business models and transaction boundaries |
| Migrations | Alembic | Versioned schema |
| Validator | pydantic-settings | Single environment layer with startup validation |
| Scheduler | Dedicated async task + database queries | Crash-safe expiration, serialized in DB; no Redis requirement for v1 |
| Image processing | Pillow for bundled assets | Static fallback PNG |
| Deployment | Dockerfile + railway.json | Reproducible root deployment |

## Recipient selection and security

1. `TARGET_CHAT_ID` from Railway if set; must match a discovered private Business Chat.
2. Explicitly selected saved Business Chat in the creation wizard.
3. `TARGET_USER_ID` from Railway matched against discovered chat's user ID.
4. `TARGET_USERNAME`, only if an observed chat has that username.
5. Exactly one eligible observed Business Chat if no explicit target exists.

Reject ambiguous Business Connections and stale chats. A Telegram username alone is not a valid direct-message address. Both Business Connection and right `can_reply` must be active. A verified user callback is permitted without having started the bot, but only for the matching Offer recipient; blocked users cannot act.

## State machine

```text
Wizard: WAIT_URL -> WAIT_STARS -> WAIT_EXPIRATION -> WAIT_IMAGE -> WAIT_NAME
     -> WAIT_TARGET -> PREVIEW -> send/edit/cancel
Offer: draft -(confirmed Telegram send)-> active -(recipient accepts)-> accepted
             |                         |                           |
             |                         +- declined                 +- transfer_requested (DEMO)
             |                         +- expired
             |                         +- cancelled
             +- cancelled
```

`delivery_status` is separate (`sending`, `sent`, `failed`, `unknown`, `deleted`). `expires_at` is enforced in both the atomic callback transaction and periodic DB worker. For safe delivery uncertainty, no automatic duplicate sends. Captions are edited by the worker when possible.

## Next stage (not included)

A genuine Telegram Gift Offer or NFT/Stars transfer must use officially supported actor permissions and transactions, separate from the demo state machine. `app/services/transfer.py` defines a narrow request-validation port. It does not authenticate end-user MTProto sessions, collect credentials, or perform transactions. Additional service design and live API verification will be required before any real-money/NFT implementation.
